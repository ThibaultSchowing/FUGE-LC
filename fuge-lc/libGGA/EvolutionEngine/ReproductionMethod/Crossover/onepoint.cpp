  *
  * @brief  A one point crossover is a method of reproduction capable of
  * creating two new entities from two parents entitites.
  * One point method consist in cuting in two parts both parents entities
  * by randomly choosing the position of the cut. Then exchange the first
  * part of the parent genome with the second parent genome first part.
  * Two new individuals are then created that are the fruit of a combination
  * of both parents.
